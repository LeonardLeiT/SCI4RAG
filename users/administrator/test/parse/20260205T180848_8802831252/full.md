A prototype Schwarz crystal (SC) structure of dividing–space minimal grain boundaries (GBs) constrained by coherent twin boundaries (CTBs) was recently discovered in extremely fine-grained polycrystalline Cu. In this Letter, constraining effects of $3 D$ CTB network on the formation and thermostability of SC are addressed via atomistic simulations. GB migration and evolution of CTB network trigger formation of SC diamond. CTB constraints are critical to generate GBs of zero mean curvature underlying vanishing capillary pressure, and to counterbalance the elastic driving forces of lattice. GB motion can be suppressed at temperatures close to the melting point with GB aperture down to $3 \ \mathrm { n m }$ .

In polycrystalline copper consisting of grains of a few nanometers in size, a metastable structure was discovered in which grain boundaries (GBs) constrained by quadrupolar network of coherent twin boundaries (CTB) resemble essentially the triply periodic minimal surface ( ) of Schwarz primitive diamond $( D )$ , as illustrated TPMS Din Fig. 1. Such polycrystalline structures of metals are found to exhibit superior thermal and mechanical stabilities than any other forms of metastable solid states known so far, for example, the metallic glasses. The extremely finegrained structures with GB or interfacial morphologies featured by any topological manifold of minimal surface, called Schwarz crystal (SC), may represent a novel type of intrinsic metastable state in polycrystalline metals at an ultimate grain size limit [1].

The combination of experiments, atomistic modeling and simulations evidenced that SC of pure Cu remains stable, either in grain morphology or in grain size, at temperatures close to the equilibrium melting point of the bulk lattice $T _ { E }$ , 1358 K). It is remarkably hard at room TEtemperatures, with an ideal strength (more than 2 GPa) close to the theoretical limit. The structure does not break down in a sudden way prior to significant plastic deformations under tensile loading in the entire temperature range. Similar structures and behaviors are also observed in other face-centered-cubic (fcc) metals such as pure Al and Al-Mg alloys [20,21]. Exampled with Cu, the present study aims to address the transformation of Schwarz crystals from nanograined polycrystals with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Structural characteristics and thermal stabilities of Schwarz crystals are analyzed and compared with experimental observations.

As a first concrete and successful mathematical solution of Plateau’s problem, perhaps the Schwarz primitive $D$ surface, together with primitive $P$ Dsurface, are of most Pfrequently mentioned s in mathematics and physics T[22,23]. The minimal $P$ MSand $D$ surface are also closely

related to the gyroid in that they are contained in the same associate (Bonnet $\mathbf { R } ^ { 3 }$ ) family [2,24–26]. In Fig. 1(a), the form of unit $D$ surface in a cubic cell can be viewed as a Dskew quadrilateral with two pairs of sides of equal lengths, each embedded in one tetrahedron (such as $A D j q$ or ADjq Bijhand so on), expended in certain series as an [111] orientated enclosure. The smooth surface contains infinite numbers of straight lines and is of zero mean curvature everywhere. As the surface triply fills up the space, the cubic box fulfills the 3D periodic boundary conditions as a supercell.

Whether morphologies occur in condensed mat-TPMSter is always intriguing [27–30]. Consider the supercell in Fig. 1(a) as part of a bulk fcc lattice (e.g., Cu) in $\left. 1 0 0 \right.$ cubic orientations, it is by no means apparent that embedding the $D$ surface would result in a structural unit both Dspace filling and stable, as in doing so, GBs other than the $D$ surface could be generated due to crystallographic Ddivision of space. Although we know now both general GB and special CTB in the Schwarz $D$ crystal mutually Dconstitute one symmetric solution of a unit cell representing a new form of the metastable state in fcc metals such as Cu [Fig. 1(b)], we did not tackle the problem in this way in the beginning. An alternative approach, the well-known Kelvin conjecture [31], has been initially implemented in our modeling and simulations, inspired by concept such as how possibly a CTB network may form in space, based on that truncated octahedron-shaped grains and numerous CTBs are frequently observed in extremely fine-grained metals like Cu revealing meanwhile an enhanced thermostability [1,32,33].

As revealed in Fig. 1(c) and Fig. 2, starting from Kelvin packing of sixteen truncated octahedral grains in such a way that grains O1 and O2 of $\left. 1 0 0 \right.$ cubic lattice orientations are surrounded by those of strictly specified h112i orientations, a space-filling 3D CTB (Σ3) network can be constructed, merged with other GBs of Σ9 families formed by h122 ¯ i, $\langle { \bar { 1 } } 8 4 \rangle$ , and $\langle 4 4 \bar { 7 } \rangle$ orientated grains [Fig. 2(a) and

the Supplemental Material [3] ]. Such a unique Kelvin crystal (KC) may transform into a SC via thermal activations or aided by mechanical stimuli (Ref. [1] and Supplemental Material [3]). In our present case, the structural transition from KC to SC occurs upon heating [Fig. 1(c)] during which the same KC may transform either into an SC shown in Fig. 1(b) ( –SC I) or into that shown in Fig. 1(d) ( –SC II).

transform into the liquid states initiated by heterogenous GB melting, underlying that the migration of GBs in SC can been completely suppressed at temperatures close to the melting point [Fig. 1(c)].

At low homologous temperatures $( T < T _ { E } / 3$ ), a $\Sigma 9$ GB formed by $\langle { \bar { 1 } } 2 2 \rangle$ T < TE=oriented grains may readily dissociate into a Σ3 CTB and a $\Sigma 3 ^ { \prime }$ GB (none–CTB) according to $\pm \Sigma 9 $ $\pm \Sigma 3 \pm \Sigma 3 ^ { \prime }$ [35–37], where $\pm$ distinguishes opposite directions of GB plane normal. The decomposition occurs preferentially at corners (quadrupolar points, QPs) and edges (triple lines, TLs) of the initial GB network [Fig. 2(a)], such

that the KC can be energetically relaxed. Meanwhile, since the decomposed GBs are intrinsically mobile, it also leads to enhanced geometry complications, resulting in significant precursor effect that may influence the way how the CTB network expands (longitudinal or transverse) to trigger transformation from KC to SC at high temperatures. Interestingly, the constriction into Schwarz $D$ –GB does not Doccur due to annihilation of dissociated GBs of opposite signs, but rather via the combination of $\Sigma 9$ GBs, i.e., $\pm \Sigma 9 \pm \Sigma 9 ^ { \prime }  \pm \Sigma 9 ^ { \prime \prime }$ , by which reversed GB reactions, i.e., $\pm \Sigma 3 \pm \Sigma 3 ^ { \prime }  \pm \Sigma 9 .$ , are involved.

Atoms in red mark the trace of the $D$ Psurface according to Eq. (1). CTB constraining effects are D Dschematically represented by arrows underlying counterbalanced and hence vanishing GB tension forces for GB motion.

Our MD observations revealed that the transformation from KC to SC is strongly constrained by the 3 -CTB Dnetwork, through which nodes (QPs) and edges (TLs) of the GB network in a KC can be completely eliminated. Individual grains disappear via enhanced activities such as GB reactions. The original GB network is replaced by a new one, through which the total GB area is minimized effectively and the unique morphology of the Schwarz - minimal surface is adopted.

Since GBs in a Schwarz crystal are of vanishing curvature, the capillary pressure $( P )$ on the GB is minimal $( P \to 0$ P) according to the Young-Laplace law

$$
P = 2 \gamma_ {G B} / R, \tag {3}
$$

where $\gamma _ { \mathrm { G B } }$ is the GB energy and $R$ is the mean GB radius of Rcurvature. However, deviation from the minimal curvature condition is expected because significant thermal fluctuations is inevitable at high temperatures.

An additional pressure ( ) may also arise when neigh-Sboring lattices of the GB are under an appreciable stress $( \tau )$

$$
S = \frac {\tau^ {2}}{2} \left(\frac {1}{E _ {A}} - \frac {1}{E _ {B}}\right), \tag {4}
$$

where $E _ { A }$ and $E _ { B }$ are Young’s moduli of neighboring grains $A$ and $B$ EB, respectively [38]. Since a crystalline lattice is A Bintrinsically anharmonic and anisotropic, $E _ { A } \neq E _ { B }$ , which EA EBmeans thermally a persisting driving force tends to be

imposed for GB motion. When deviate away from the morphology, GB migration constitutes the major TPMSmode of motion although it may be coupled with other activities such as GB sliding [39]. Suppose that the critical pressure for GB migration is $P _ { c }$ , the temperature $( T _ { S } )$ at Pc TSwhich a SC is rendered thermally unstable can then be measured by

$$
p \left(T _ {S}\right) = P \left(T _ {S}\right) + S \left(T _ {S}\right) = P _ {c}. \tag {5}
$$

The $T _ { S }$ of CTB-free  GBs can be assessed using a TSSC in Schwarz $P$ TPMSform ( -SC) by Kelvin packing of two P Ptruncated octahedral grains. A $P$ -SC with $\pm \Sigma 9 ^ { \prime \prime } .$ –type GBs similar to those in $D$ P-SC has been shown in Fig. 3(a). The DGB energy is calculated to be $\gamma _ { \mathrm { G B } } \sim 1 ~ \mathrm { e V } / \mathrm { m } ^ { 2 }$ (0 K) given that the GB area $( A _ { \mathrm { G B } } )$ = is known exactly, which is ${ \sim } 2 . 3 5 a ^ { 2 }$ for -SC and ${ \sim } 2 . 4 2 a ^ { 2 }$ for -SC [2,26]. Such a $P$ -SC is P athermally stable up to $6 8 0 \mathrm { ~ K ~ }$ P at which GBs collapse promptly [Fig. 3(b)]. That is, either for -SC or for $D$ - P DSC, GBs of minimal surface are intrinsically mobile defects which would readily migrate at $T _ { S } \sim 0 . 5 T _ { E }$ . Structure TS TEanalyses in terms of the 1st nearest-neighbor angular distribution function (ADF) indicate that significant amount of GB atoms is disordered [Fig. 3(c)], underlying that the GB migration is assisted by thermally activated GB diffusivities. Figure 3(d) shows that substantial nonvanishing GB curvature can be developed at temperatures below $T _ { S }$ .

CTB constraints are essential to account for the unusual thermostability of $T _ { S } \sim 0 . 9 8 T _ { E }$ achieved by -SC I/II. TS TE DSince twinned lattices show up successively on both sides of the GB, the driving forces imposed on different portions of GB are of the same magnitude but in opposite directions [Eq. (4) and Fig. 3(e)], by which a minimal pressure condition holds up to the melting point of GB, irrespective of thermal fluctuations and $P _ { c }$ , i.e., at $T \leq T _ { m } ^ { \mathrm { G B } }$

$$
\langle S (T) \rangle \rightarrow 0, \tag {6}
$$

or

$$
p (T) = P (T) + \langle S (T) \rangle \rightarrow 0, \tag {7}
$$

where $\langle . . . \rangle$ denotes the mean driving force under CTB constrains. As an alternative evidence of Eq. (6), both $D$ - DSC I and II are found ideally isotropic according to our calculated elastic moduli (see Supplemental Material [3]), in accordance with the zero–pressure condition $( E _ { A } = E _ { B }$ ) of Eq. (4). In short, the structures of Schwarz $D$ EA EB-GBs bound Dtogether with CTBs represent the case where the mean driving force for GB migration is also minimal even at temperatures close to $T _ { E }$ , a condition difficult to attain otherwise.

-SC I and II of smaller sizes ( ) also form (see D aSupplemental Material [3]). The KC–to–SC transformation temperature drops down when a KC is constructed with smaller Kelvin cells. The limiting thermostability measured by $T _ { S } / T _ { E }$ as a function of the aperture size of $D$ -SC $( D _ { S } )$ TS=TE D DShas been illustrated in Fig. 4(a). Among them, S0 and S1 are found most stable and GB migration can be completely suppressed at temperatures close to the melting point above a size limit of $D _ { S } = 3 ~ \mathrm { n m }$ . Smaller $D$ -SCs, on the other DS Dhand, can be destabilized as a consequence of CTB and/or GB annihilation. The onset temperature of destabilization drops down significantly from $0 . 9 4 T _ { E }$ (S2) to $0 . 4 T _ { E }$ (S4). TE TEFor S4, the tiny cell contains merely 3016 atoms and nearly one third of them can be identified as GB atoms, enhanced GB interactions must account for the instability. Yet, comparing to conventional polycrystals, a thermal stability of $0 . 4 T _ { E }$ is still promising at such a grain size regime.

TEIdentifying the -SC morphology at atomic scales Dremains challenging experimentally because the topological structure contains high-density GBs and CTBs. However, the structural symmetries of $D$ -SC I as revealed Din Fig. 1(a) and Fig. 4(b) provide following hints. (i) The h111i channels of $D$ -SC should be most transparent to Delectron beams because only one set of CTBs shows up in each aperture normal. (ii) Electron beams are less transparent along $\langle 0 \bar { 1 } 1 \rangle$ orientations as all sets of CTBs $( \alpha , \beta , \gamma , \delta )$ show up and incline to each other. (iii) Along ; ; ;all other orientations, electrons tend to be scattered away due to highly disordered GB atoms and overlapped GBs. As such, symbolic honeycombed grains of circular shape or manifolded bright and dark strips are observable experimentally, as shown in Fig. 4(c) or Fig. 1 in Ref. [1].

Understanding the nature of GBs and interfaces is vital to predict material properties [40–43]. With this study, we demonstrated that limiting grain size of a few nanometers is approachable in conventional metals if an interface network is prone to a unique form underlying remarkable thermal stability. Our simulations show that in Schwarz $D$ -crystals, D GBs remain to be lattice defects highly energetic TPMSand intrinsically mobile. However, distinct from those as conjectured by Kelvin crystals, they are stable topological defects of vanishing mean curvature. GBs of much lower energies and intrinsically less mobile, such as CTBs in fcc metals, remain to be planar defects and may act as strong constraints against GB motion. Schwarz crystals, including those of lattice structures of other types, point the way for future advances of structurally stable materials.
