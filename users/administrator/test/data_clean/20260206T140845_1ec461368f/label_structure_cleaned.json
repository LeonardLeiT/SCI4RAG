    "content": "Schwarz crystals with uniformly distributed twins enclosed by general grain boundaries (GBs) resembling triply minimal-surfaces were observed in high stacking fault energy metal Pt which is believed not readily to twin. By refining the grains of pure Pt from $140~\\mu \\mathrm{m}$ to several nanometers via plastic deformation technique, deformation twins were found to emerge numerously and the structural morphologies of Schwarz crystals can be identified at grain sizes below $4\\mathrm{nm}$ . Both experiments and atomistic simulations suggest that Pt Schwarz crystals are thermally stable at temperatures approaching the thermal equilibrium melting point. The measured room temperature microhardness as a function of grain size, on the other hand, may increase monotonically up to $12.9\\mathrm{GPa}$ , revealing a sustained Hall-Petch relationship. The observed outstanding mechanical stabilities can be attributed to that, regardless of the critical twin size and the stacking fault energy of the material, the plastic deformation at the grain size limit is solely limited by twinning and both the nucleation and bowing-out of twinning partial dislocations from GB sources are notoriously difficult according to simulations and theory."

    "content": "Grain refinement induced by plastic deformation is an effective way to strengthen metals and their alloys. However, it remains challenging to thermally stabilize the refined microstructures because the process in general involves significant dislocation activities such as multiplication, accumulation, rearrangement, and annihilation, as well as grain boundary (GB) migration activities underlying grain growth and recrystallization [1-3]. Recent studies indicate that highly stable nanostructured metallic materials can be achieved through relaxing and optimizing GB structures to improve structural stability at grain sizes below $70~\\mathrm{nm}$ for Cu, $43~\\mathrm{nm}$ for Ni, and $77~\\mathrm{nm}$ for Ag [4,5]."

Those SCs were found to exhibit unusual thermal stabilities at temperatures close to the equilibrium melting point $(T_{\\mathrm{E}})$ as well as neartheoretical shear strength [6-8]."

    "content": "Based on extensive experimental studies, molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, and first-principles calculations, it is generally believed that stacking fault energies (SFEs) are closely relevant to deformation behaviors [9-14]. Previous studies also suggest that GB relaxation processes involving emitting of partial dislocations, stacking faults (SFs), and twins from GBs sites are strongly grain-size dependent [15-23]. For example, in metals such as Ni and Al [24-27], perfect lattice dislocations (extended) were found to dominate the deformation process at larger grain sizes (e.g. $20\\mathrm{nm}$ for Ni and $18\\mathrm{nm}$ for Al); whereas for smaller grain sizes, faulting and twinning led by Shockley-partialls may show up dominantly to contribute to plastic deformation."

As confirmed through high pressure torsion experiments [33,34], in ultrafine grains of Pt which may show a saturated microhardness of 255 Hv or $2.5\\mathrm{GPa}$ , no trace of SF or deformation twin was noticeable.

Schwarz crystals in high SFE metals such as Al have also been reported recently [39], yet, the atomistic level mechanisms accounting for the structural stability remain to be addressed. Besides the high SFE and uneasiness to twin, Pt is also a metal of high melting point $(T_{\\mathrm{E}} = 2041\\mathrm{K}$ [40]) and large bulk modulus. It is therefore of fundamental interest to see whether twins and consequently stable Schwarz crystals can be produced at the grain size limit."

Such a trend can be attributed to that, for a $D_{\\mathrm{SC}}$ value of $2.2\\mathrm{nm}$ , the SC unit cell contains merely 2072 atoms such that nearly $35\\%$ atoms can be identified as GB atoms. As a result, enhanced GBs interaction is expected under thermal fluctuations. Our MD observations suggest that deviations of GB location locally from the zero-mean curvature condition tends to develop significant stress concentrations for tiny SC cells so as to trigger twinning activities at lower temperatures upon which TPMS GBs may collapse (or recrystallize)"

Both nucleation and bow out of twinning partial dislocation, therefore, contribute to the yield strength. Unlike thermal stability, the MD measured yield stress does not tend to drop down as a function of aperture sizes. This occurs because the critical stress required to force the twinning Shockley partial bowing out (see discussion) may exceed that required to nucleate the partial from GB sites, although a decrease in nucleation energy barrier can be expected as a consequence of enhanced line curvature effects for smaller aperture sizes. The stress levels do not differ much between the $7.4\\mathrm{nm}$ and $10\\mathrm{nm}$ sized SCs in later stages of deformation, indicating that the nucleation of twinning partials is not strongly size-dependent at such sizes (Fig. 8b)."
