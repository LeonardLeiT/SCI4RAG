    "equation": "$(T_{\\mathrm{E}} = 2041\\mathrm{K}$",
    "description": "The equation provides the value of the melting point for the element platinum (Pt). Here, the symbol \\( T_{\\mathrm{E}} \\) denotes the equilibrium melting temperature, which is a fundamental material property. The equation states that this temperature is equal to 2041 Kelvin, a value cited from the referenced literature. This high melting point is a key material parameter within the manuscript's context, as it contributes to the discussion of Pt's stability and the challenges associated with forming nanostructures like Schwarz crystals at the grain size limit."

    "equation": "$D_{\\mathrm{SC}} = \\sqrt{2} /2a$",
    "description": "The equation defines the aperture, \\(D_{\\mathrm{SC}}\\), of a prototype double-Schwarz crystal structure within a cubic supercell. Here, \\(D_{\\mathrm{SC}}\\) represents the diameter of the twin structures enclosed by grain boundaries, which is equivalent to the closest spacing between triply periodic minimal surface (TPMS) grain boundaries. The variable \\(a\\) denotes the lattice constant, or side length, of the cubic supercell. The relationship shows that the aperture scales linearly with the supercell size, with the proportionality constant \\(\\sqrt{2}/2\\) arising from the geometric arrangement of the TPMS interfaces within the cubic unit cell."

    "equation": "$$\nD ^ {*} = \\frac {\\mu b}{\\sigma_ {y} \\left(D ^ {*}\\right) / m} \\tag {1}\n$$",
    "description": "Equation (1) defines the critical grain size \\( D^{*} \\) below which the dominant deformation mechanism in a polycrystal transitions from perfect dislocation activity to grain-boundary-mediated processes, such as partial dislocation emission. In this expression, \\( \\mu \\) denotes the shear modulus, \\( b \\) is the magnitude of the Burgers vector for a perfect dislocation, and \\( m \\) represents the Taylor factor, with \\( 1/m \\) being the average Schmid factor for a randomly oriented polycrystal (typically \\( m \\approx 3 \\)). The term \\( \\sigma_{y}(D^{*}) \\) is the yield stress at this critical size. The equation captures a mechanical balance condition: the critical size is proportional to the ratio of the dislocation line tension scale, \\( \\mu b \\), to the resolved shear stress driving deformation, \\( \\sigma_{y}(D^{*})/m \\). This relationship arises from an analogy to dislocation source operation, where \\( D^{*} \\) sets the length scale at which a grain boundary source can operate before the stress required to activate it exceeds the conventional yield stress."

    "equation": "$\\sigma_{y} = \\sigma_{0} + kD^{-\\frac{1}{2}} = H_{\\nu} / 3$",
    "description": "The equation relates the macroscopic yield stress of a polycrystalline material to its microstructural characteristics and measured hardness. Here, \\(\\sigma_y\\) denotes the yield stress, \\(\\sigma_0\\) is a material constant representing the lattice friction stress, \\(k\\) is the Hall–Petch coefficient, and \\(D\\) is the average grain size. The expression \\(\\sigma_0 + kD^{-1/2}\\) embodies the classical Hall–Petch relationship, which describes the grain-size strengthening mechanism whereby yield stress increases with decreasing grain size due to dislocation pile-up effects. The equality with \\(H_\\nu/3\\) provides a practical conversion, where \\(H_\\nu\\) is the Vickers microhardness; this allows the yield stress to be estimated directly from hardness measurements, assuming a typical polycrystalline Schmid factor. The equation thus serves to connect measurable hardness data and grain size to the fundamental yield behavior of the material."

    "description": "Equation (2) defines the critical twin thickness, \\(\\lambda_C\\), within a nucleation model for deformation twinning. Here, \\(\\lambda_C\\) represents the minimum thickness required for a disk-shaped twin nucleus to become stable and propagate. The expression relates this critical dimension to several material properties: \\(\\mu\\) denotes the shear modulus, \\(\\gamma_{\\mathrm{isf}}\\) is the intrinsic stacking fault energy, and \\(\\sigma_T\\) represents the applied shear stress. The parameter \\(\\rho\\) is the aspect ratio of the twin nucleus, defined as \\(\\lambda_c / r_c\\), where \\(r_c\\) is the disk radius; for a twin disk of comparable thickness and radius, \\(\\rho\\) approaches unity. The equation captures a physical balance where the critical thickness scales directly with the shear modulus and stacking fault energy, which resist twin formation, and inversely with the square of the applied stress, which drives the nucleation process."

    "equation": "$\\rho = \\lambda_c / r_c$",
    "description": "The equation defines the geometric aspect ratio $\\rho$ of a twin nucleus modeled as a disk. Here, $\\lambda_c$ denotes the critical thickness of the twin disk, and $r_c$ represents its critical radius. The parameter $\\rho$ quantifies the shape of the nucleus; a value close to unity indicates a twin disk whose thickness is comparable to its radius, which is a characteristic condition for a stable nucleus that can form and grow. This dimensionless ratio is central to a theoretical model for deformation twinning, linking the critical nucleation geometry to material properties and applied stress."

    "description": "Equation (3) gives the Orowan stress, \\(\\tau\\), which is the critical applied shear stress required to force a dislocation to bypass a circular twin boundary. In this expression, \\(\\mu\\) denotes the shear modulus, \\(b_p\\) is the magnitude of the Burgers vector for the partial dislocation, and \\(D_{sc}\\) represents the effective spacing between obstacles, here corresponding to the diameter of the twin plane. The dimensionless parameter \\(\\alpha\\) encapsulates additional geometric and material factors, including the influence of grain boundary dragging and the Schmid factor. The relationship shows that the required stress is directly proportional to the material's stiffness and the dislocation's Burgers vector, and inversely proportional to the obstacle spacing."

    "equation": "$\\alpha = 1.5$",
    "description": "The parameter $\\alpha$ denotes a dimensionless scaling constant in the Orowan strengthening model for twinning partial dislocations. This specific value, $\\alpha = 1.5$, was determined empirically to provide the best agreement between the theoretical model predictions and the experimentally measured microhardness data, as validated by the comparison shown in the manuscript's Figure 4. Its role is to scale the theoretical strengthening contribution, and its successful application confirms that the Orowan bowing mechanism is the dominant strengthening process for the studied material at grain sizes below 6 nm."
