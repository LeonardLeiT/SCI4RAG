(B) Microhardness variations as a function of annealing temperature (with a duration of 1 hour) for the nanograined Ni and Ni–Mo alloys with different Mo concentrations. (C) Variation of the maximum microhardness increment induced by annealing $( \\Delta H _ { \\mathrm { v } } / H _ { \\mathrm { v 0 } } ; H _ { \\mathrm { v 0 } }$ is the initial hardness) as a function of initial grain size for the Ni and Ni–Mo samples (solid symbols).
