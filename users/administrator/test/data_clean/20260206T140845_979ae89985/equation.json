    "equation": "$k = 3k_{\\mathrm{B}}T / \\langle \\Delta \\vec{r}_i^2\\rangle$",
    "description": "The spring constant \\(k\\) is derived from the equipartition theorem, which relates thermal energy to the mean-squared displacement of atoms in thermal equilibrium. In this expression, \\(k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) denotes the Boltzmann constant, \\(T\\) represents the absolute temperature, and \\(\\langle \\Delta \\vec{r}_i^2\\rangle\\) is the vibrational mean-squared displacement (vMSD) of an atom \\(i\\) about its equilibrium position. The equation quantitatively links the atomic-scale stiffness to vibrational motion: a larger mean-squared displacement corresponds to a smaller spring constant, indicating weaker constraints on atomic motion, while a higher spring constant reflects reduced vibrational amplitudes and a more rigid local environment."

    "equation": "$F_{\\mathrm{E}}(N,V,T) = 3Nk_{\\mathrm{B}}T\\ln \\left(\\frac{\\hbar\\omega}{k_{\\mathrm{B}}T}\\right)$",
    "description": "The equation provides the Helmholtz free energy \\(F_{\\mathrm{E}}\\) of an Einstein crystal model as a function of the number of atoms \\(N\\), volume \\(V\\), and temperature \\(T\\). Here, \\(k_{\\mathrm{B}}\\) denotes the Boltzmann constant, \\(\\hbar\\) is the reduced Planck constant, and \\(\\omega\\) represents the characteristic vibrational frequency of an atom in the harmonic potential, defined as \\(\\omega = \\sqrt{k/m}\\), where \\(k\\) is the effective spring constant and \\(m\\) is the atomic mass. The expression captures the thermodynamic contribution from \\(3N\\) independent quantum harmonic oscillators, each with frequency \\(\\omega\\). The logarithmic term \\(\\ln(\\hbar\\omega/k_{\\mathrm{B}}T)\\) quantifies the balance between the quantum vibrational energy scale and thermal energy, determining how the free energy varies with temperature. This analytical form serves as a reference state in thermodynamic integration methods for computing the free energy of more complex systems."

    "equation": "$\\omega = \\sqrt{k / m}$",
    "description": "The equation defines the vibrational frequency $\\omega$ of a harmonic oscillator, where $k$ denotes the spring constant and $m$ represents the atomic mass. This relationship arises from the classical mechanics of a simple harmonic oscillator, indicating that the frequency is proportional to the square root of the stiffness constant and inversely proportional to the square root of the mass. In the context of the Einstein crystal model, this frequency is a fundamental parameter that characterizes the atomic vibrations, directly linking the microscopic mechanical properties—stiffness and inertia—to the thermodynamic behavior via the vibrational partition function."

    "description": "The equation defines the free energy \\( F_{\\mathrm{i}}(N,V,T) \\) of the target system of interest in terms of a reference Einstein crystal free energy and a correction derived from nonequilibrium work measurements. Here, \\( F_{\\mathrm{i}} \\) denotes the Helmholtz free energy of the interacting system, which is a function of particle number \\( N \\), volume \\( V \\), and temperature \\( T \\). The term \\( F_{\\mathrm{E}}(N,V,T) \\) represents the analytically known free energy of the Einstein crystal reference state. The correction involves the irreversible work, where \\( \\overline{W_{1\\rightarrow 2}^{\\mathrm{irr}}} \\) and \\( \\overline{W_{2\\rightarrow 1}^{\\mathrm{irr}}} \\) are the ensemble-averaged irreversible works measured along the forward and reverse directions, respectively, of a nonequilibrium thermodynamic integration path connecting the interacting system and the Einstein crystal. The relationship captures the central result of the Frenkel-Ladd method, showing that the free energy difference is obtained by averaging the dissipated work from bidirectional switching simulations, thereby canceling out systematic errors and yielding a precise estimate of the equilibrium free energy."

    "description": "The equation \\(S_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = -\\frac{\\partial F(T)}{\\partial T}\\) defines the vibrational entropy of a system as a function of temperature. Here, \\(S_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T)\\) denotes the vibrational entropy at temperature \\(T\\), and \\(F(T)\\) represents the Helmholtz free energy of the system. The partial derivative with respect to temperature, taken at constant volume, captures the fundamental thermodynamic relationship where the vibrational entropy is the negative temperature derivative of the free energy. This expression quantifies how the system's vibrational disorder increases with temperature, directly linking the entropic contribution to the temperature dependence of the free energy."

    "equation": "$D_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\sqrt{2} /2L$",
    "description": "The equation defines the characteristic size of a diamondoid supracrystal (D-SC) in terms of its structural geometry. Here, \\( D_{\\mathrm{s}} \\) denotes the aperture diameter of the D-SC, which serves as the key metric for its effective size, and \\( L \\) represents the cubic box length of the supracrystal unit. The relationship expresses that the aperture diameter is proportional to the box length, scaled by the constant factor \\( \\sqrt{2}/2 \\). This geometric scaling arises from the specific spatial arrangement within the diamondoid framework, linking the macroscopic observable size directly to the underlying unit cell dimension."
