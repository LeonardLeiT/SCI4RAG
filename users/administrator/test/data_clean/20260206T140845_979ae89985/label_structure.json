    "content": "ABSTRACT: The discovery of Schwarz nanocrystals (SCs)—characterized by interpenetrating networks of minimal surface grain boundaries (GBs) stabilized by coherent twin boundaries (CTBs)—has pushed the boundaries of nanoscience and nanotechnology to length scales of only a few nanometers. However, the physical mechanisms governing the thermal stability remain unresolved. Here we establish a free energy criterion for thermal stability of SC using large-scale thermodynamic integration, benchmarking SCs against other nanostructures such as Voronoi and Kelvin nanocrystals. Surprisingly, the free energy of minimal surface GBs in SCs is higher than that of conventional GBs in the Voronoi nanocrystal. Therefore, the competition between decreasing the GB volume fraction and increasing the local GB energy imposes a fundamental size limit. Kinetic stabilization of SCs is accommodated by the topological interlock between the CTBs and GBs. The free energy-based criterion for stability of SCs provides a rule for selecting Schwarz-like nanostructures stable at extreme conditions."

When the grain size shrinks to below $100\\mathrm{nm}$ , crystals enter the nanoscale regime, exhibiting a diverse range of exceptional mechanical and functional properties. $^{1,2}$ These superior properties primarily arise from the increased density of GBs, $^{3}$ which can constitute up to about $30\\%$ of the volume in nanocrystals with grain sizes as small as $10\\mathrm{nm}$ . Mechanically, GBs act as formidable barriers to dislocation motion, thereby enhancing the strength through the Hall-Petch relationship. $^{5,6}$ By reducing grain size to an optimal value, the strength of nanocrystals can approach the theoretical limit. $^{7-9}$ However, this strengthening mechanism ceases to operate at extremely small grain sizes because GBs, characterized by their high structural disorder, are prone to experience instability. $^{10,11}$ Consequently, metastable nanocrystals strive to minimize free energy by reducing total GBs area, $^{12}$ which promotes grain growth that degrades mechanical performances. $^{12-14}$ The mechanism of grain growth in materials parallels the coarsening of bubble junctions in foams during drainage, where the topology of the bubbles dictates the stabilization of junctions. Similarly, the topology of GBs in nanocrystals plays a crucial role in resisting coarsening by mitigating internal stresses, $^{15}$ influencing diffusion pathways, $^{16}$ and altering energy barriers. $^{17}$ Therefore, optimizing the GBs topology has emerged as a general strategy to enhance the thermal stability of nanoscale materials. $^{18,19}$"

According to the equipartition theorem, $k = 3k_{\\mathrm{B}}T / \\langle \\Delta \\vec{r}_i^2\\rangle$ , where $\\langle \\Delta \\vec{r}_i^2\\rangle$ represents the vibrational mean-squared displacement (vMSD) at thermodynamic equilibrium. Higher $k$ values correspond to reduced vibrational amplitudes, indicating stronger constraints. The system-averaged spring constants can be grouped into three categories: the highest values observed in FCC Bulk due to the absence of defects. Following this, the SCs exhibit intermediate stiffnesses with D-SC II exhibiting the highest $k$ value. Lastly, Kelvin and Voronoi nanocrystals display similar atomic stiffness, with the Voronoi nanocrystal being the softest. These results demonstrate the enhanced elastic stability of Schwarz nanocrystals. As temperature rises, vibrations intensify, enhancing oscillations of atoms which leads to a higher degree of disorder.

To address this, the variations of vMSDs with time at different temperatures are shown in Figure S3 of the SI, ensuring temporary stability of configurations.

Kelvin nanocrystal exhibits lower free energy than Voronoi nanocrystal, which indicates that the truncated-octahedral grain arrangement is energetically favorable, aligning with experimental observations.[20] This energetic preference also supports the role of the Kelvin nanocrystal as a precursor to SCs upon heating.[22] Across all crystals, a general decline in the free energy difference is observed with increasing temperature. This is reasonable due to the contribution of vibrational entropy to free energy. At $1300\\mathrm{K}$ , near the $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ , the Kelvin and Voronoi nanocrystals exhibit higher free energies compared with the FCC lattice, reflecting their pronounced thermal instability and propensity for structural transitions to lower-free-energy states. In contrast, the free energies of SCs remain smaller and converge toward zero near the $T_{\\mathrm{m}}$ . The unique Schwarz topology contributes to strong resilience against entropy-driven disorder. This is further validated by quantifying the vibrational entropy, $S_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = -\\frac{\\partial F(T)}{\\partial T}$ , as shown in Figure S4 of SI.

From a thermodynamic perspective, the underlying mechanisms governing this size limitation can be examined through free energy analysis. As illustrated in Figure 3(a), the characteristic size of the D-SC is defined by the aperture diameter, expressed as $D_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\sqrt{2} /2L$ where $L$ denotes the cubic box length of the D-SC. Here we constructed 15 D-SC models with $D_{\\mathrm{s}}$ ranging from 1.57 to 9.57 nm, covering the typical size explored in both experiments[20] and simulations.[22,27] Their free energies are calculated from 100 to $400\\mathrm{K}$ , which are shown in Figure 3(b). The results reveal a pronounced increase in free energy as size decreases regardless of temperature, particularly in the size range from 1.57 to $2.76\\mathrm{nm}$ . Notably, Figure 3(c) shows that a sharp increase in $T_{\\mathrm{c}}$ (the critical instability temperature), coinciding with a rapid variation in free energy. The origin of this size limit can be further attributed to the increasing volume fraction of GBs in the nanocrystals. As shown in Figure 3(d), the disordered atoms in GBs decline remarkably within a narrow grain size window in both D-SC I and Voronoi crystal, mirroring the variation in free energy. This abrupt increase likely leads to a critical threshold, marking the refinement limit of the D-SC structure."

In terms of free energy, Figure 4(b) shows that the CTBs and grains exhibit similar thermodynamic stability, with free energy profiles significantly lower than those of GBs. This suggests that the free energy of SCs is predominantly concentrated within the GBs regions. Consequently, optimizing the proportion of GBs and reducing GB energy density are likely critical strategies for enhancing the thermal stability of nanocrystals with extremely fine grain sizes. Figure 3(d) has confirmed that D-SC adopts the former strategy."

As shown in Figure 4(c), the GB free energies in different nanocrystals reveal an intriguing result. The minimal surface GBs in SCs exhibit higher free energy per atom than those in the Voronoi nanocrystal. This discrepancy can be attributed to local curvature differences: while the GBs in Voronoi nanocrystals are nearly flat, the minimal surface GBs in SCs are highly curved locally, which may elevate their energy despite maintaining zero mean curvature overall. However, when considering the system holistically, Figure S5 reveals that the total excess energy from GBs in SCs remains lower than in conventional nanocrystals due to the reduced GB volume fraction. This trade-off between minimizing the total GB volume and increasing the local GB energy further explains the intrinsic size limitation of SCs."

Despite the P-SC being of TPMS GB structure, it does not demonstrate superior stability compared with the Voronoi nanocrystal. The failure of the P-SC underscores the limited capacity of the TPMS in SCs to retain structural integrity. This instability can be attributed to the high free energy concentrated at such unique GBs [Figure 4(c)]. Although the zero-mean-curvature property of TPMS minimizes the driving force for further GBs coarsening, thermal fluctuation can still disrupt the curvature, potentially leading to structural collapse.

While lower free energy is conventionally associated with enhanced thermodynamic stability, it does not fully prevent grain coarsening in nanocrystals. In the absence of CTBs, GBs migration persists at high temperatures, because the GB free energy consistently exceeds that of a perfect lattice. The phase stability of SCs is governed by two critical factors. First, from a thermodynamic perspective, the free energy of SCs must be sufficiently low. This condition is met by minimizing the GBs volume fraction in SCs, although the GB free energy of minimal surfaces is not necessarily lower than that of conventional GBs in Voronoi nanocrystals. Second, from a kinetic perspective, the stability of SCs primarily depends on the role of CTBs in constraining GBs motion. This study provides fundamental insights into the physical mechanisms underpinning the thermal stability of SCs, highlighting the critical importance of the 3D interlocking topology formed by CTBs and GBs. The theoretical findings contribute to the design of thermally stable nanocrystals with unprecedentedly fine grains, potentially unlocking novel functionalities and properties of nanostructures at the atomic scale."
