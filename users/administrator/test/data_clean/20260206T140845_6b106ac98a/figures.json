A bright-field TEM image (A) and the electron diffraction pattern (inset) show roughly equiaxed submicrometer-sized grains with random orientations separated by high-angle GBs. The statistical distributions for grain size (B) and for thickness of the twin/matrix lamellae (C) were obtained from the many TEM images of the same sample. Electron diffraction patterns [inset in (D)] indicate that the twins in each grain are parallel to each other in {111} planes (D), and high-resolution TEM images (E) show that the twins follow a sequence of ATATA. . ., with twinning elements, for example, A: (1\u0001 11\u0001 )/[1\u0001 12] and T: (1\u0001 11)/[11\u0001 2]."

The inset shows the geometry of the tensile sample for the as-deposited nano-twin sample (R, radius of curvature). (B) The measured temperature dependence of electrical resistivity (\u000e) for the as-deposited nano-twin Cu sample and the coarsegrained sample in a temperature range from 2 to 296 K. For comparison, electrical resistivity measurement results in a nanocrystalline Cu sample with a mean grain size of $1 5 \\mathsf { n m }$ are also included."
