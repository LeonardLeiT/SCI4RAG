As grain size decreases into the nanoscale, grain coarsening occurs at much lower temperatures, as low as ambient temperatures for some metals. We discovered that nanometer-sized grains in pure copper and nickel produced from plastic deformation at low temperatures exhibit notable thermal stability below a critical grain size. The instability temperature rises substantially at smaller grain sizes, and the nanograins remain stable even above the recrystallization temperatures of coarse grains. The inherent thermal stability of nanograins originates from an autonomous grain boundary evolution to low-energy states due to activation of partial dislocations in plastic deformation."

But the introduced high density of grain boundaries (GBs) provides a strong driving force for grain coarsening accompanied by property degradation. The instability temperature, which marks the onset of grain coarsening, decreases substantially for nanometer-sized grains in metals (1-3). In some nanograined metals, such as Cu, coarsening occurs even at ambient temperatures (1, 4). The inherent thermal instability is an \"Achilles' heel\" of nanograined materials and hinders technological applications at elevated temperatures. The temperature response also complicates the processing of nanograined metals for further structure refinement and property enhancements (1)."

Coarsening kinetics can be suppressed by pinning GBs with a second-phase drag, a solute or impurity drag, or by chemical ordering (5-8). Lowering GB energy by solute segregation may reduce the thermodynamic driving force for coarsening and hence stabilize the nanograins as well, as observed in FeP, Ni-P, and Pd-Zr systems (9-11). But these alloy-based approaches may unavoidably influence, and often deteriorate, mechanical, physical, or chemical properties of nanograined materials. Stabilizing nanograined structures in pure metals without alloying is technically challenging."

Apparently, reduced interfacial excess energy is effective to stabilize nanostructures in pure metals (I). Nevertheless, generating three-dimensional nanograins in pure metals with every GB in a low-energy state is practically very difficult. We discovered an autonomous structural evolution in GBs toward low-energy states in pure Cu and Ni as the grain sizes were reduced below a critical value by plastic deformation. This evolution led to notable thermal stability in nanograins, for which the apparent instability temperature was even higher than that for coarse grains."

Because of the high strain rates and low temperatures, plastic deformation in the top surface layer of the SMGT samples is dominated by the formation of stacking faults and twin boundaries. In terms of the grain refinement mechanism discussed previously in the literature (27, 28), most nanograins were formed from fragmentation or shear banding of the lamellar bundles of nanoscale twins and stacking faults, generating plenty of GBs that are in low-energy configurations, analogous to those in the nanograined Cu produced from dynamic plastic deformation (18). TEM observations of the SMGT Ni samples showed that the fraction of grains containing twins or stacking faults in the top surface layer is much higher than that in deep layers (14) (fig. S6)."

Simulations and experimental investigations on a range of tilt GBs in several face-centered cubic metals indicated that dissociation of GBs occurs by emission of stacking faults (29). This provides a general mode of GB relaxation, especially in metals with low stacking fault energies, such as Cu. Similar processes are anticipated in high-stacking fault energy metals such as Ni under high shear stress, as in our process. Formation of nanometer-scale"

However, very small-grained materials start to coarsen at relatively low temperatures, wiping out their most desirable properties. Zhou et al. discovered a way to avoid this problem by mechanically grinding copper and nickel at liquid nitrogen temperatures. The processing method creates low-angle grain boundaries between the nanograins, which promotes thermal stability."
