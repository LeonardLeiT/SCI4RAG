However, the physical mechanisms governing the thermal stability remain unresolved. Here we establish a free energy criterion for thermal stability of SC using large-scale thermodynamic integration, benchmarking SCs against other nanostructures such as Voronoi and Kelvin nanocrystals. Surprisingly, the free energy of minimal surface GBs in SCs is higher than that of conventional GBs in the Voronoi nanocrystal. Therefore, the competition between decreasing the GB volume fraction and increasing the local GB energy imposes a fundamental size limit. Kinetic stabilization of SCs is accommodated by the topological interlock between the CTBs and GBs. The free energy-based criterion for stability of SCs provides a rule for selecting Schwarz-like nanostructures stable at extreme conditions."

Kelvin nanocrystal exhibits lower free energy than Voronoi nanocrystal, which indicates that the truncated-octahedral grain arrangement is energetically favorable, aligning with experimental observations.[20] This energetic preference also supports the role of the Kelvin nanocrystal as a precursor to SCs upon heating.[22] Across all crystals, a general decline in the free energy difference is observed with increasing temperature. This is reasonable due to the contribution of vibrational entropy to free energy. At \\(1300\\mathrm{K}\\), near the \\(T_{\\mathrm{m}}\\), the Kelvin and Voronoi nanocrystals exhibit higher free energies compared with the FCC lattice, reflecting their pronounced thermal instability and propensity for structural transitions to lower-free-energy states. In contrast, the free energies of SCs remain smaller and converge toward zero near the \\(T_{\\mathrm{m}}\\). The unique Schwarz topology contributes to strong resilience against entropy-driven disorder. This is further validated by quantifying the vibrational entropy, \\(S_{\\mathrm{vib}}(T) = -\\frac{\\partial F(T)}{\\partial T}\\), as shown in Figure S4 of SI. The vibrational entropy of SCs is notably lower than that of the Kelvin and Voronoi nanocrystals, corroborating the enhanced thermal stability of SCs in terms of vibrational disorder."

From a thermodynamic perspective, the underlying mechanisms governing this size limitation can be examined through free energy analysis. As illustrated in Figure 3(a), the characteristic size of the D-SC is defined by the aperture diameter, expressed as \\(D_{\\mathrm{s}} = \\sqrt{2} /2L\\) where \\(L\\) denotes the cubic box length of the D-SC. Here we constructed 15 D-SC models with \\(D_{\\mathrm{s}}\\) ranging from 1.57 to 9.57 nm, covering the typical size explored in both experiments[20] and simulations.[22,27] Their free energies are calculated from 100 to \\(400\\mathrm{K}\\), which are shown in Figure 3(b). The results reveal a pronounced increase in free energy as size decreases regardless of temperature, particularly in the size range from 1.57 to \\(2.76\\mathrm{nm}\\). Notably, Figure 3(c) shows that a sharp increase in \\(T_{\\mathrm{c}}\\) (the critical instability temperature), coinciding with a rapid variation in free energy. The origin of this size limit can be further attributed to the increasing volume fraction of GBs in the nanocrystals. As shown in Figure 3(d), the disordered atoms in GBs decline remarkably within a narrow grain size window in both D-SC I and Voronoi crystal, mirroring the variation in free energy. This abrupt increase likely leads to a critical threshold, marking the refinement limit of the D-SC structure."

Among them, GBs exhibit the lowest mechanical stability as characterized by the lowest spring constants in Figure 4(a). In contrast, CTBs and crystallites display spring constants comparable to the bulk value. In terms of free energy, Figure 4(b) shows that the CTBs and grains exhibit similar thermodynamic stability, with free energy profiles significantly lower than those of GBs. This suggests that the free energy of SCs is predominantly concentrated within the GBs regions. Consequently, optimizing the proportion of GBs and reducing GB energy density are likely critical strategies for enhancing the thermal stability of nanocrystals with extremely fine grain sizes. Figure 3(d) has confirmed that D-SC adopts the former strategy."

As shown in Figure 4(c), the GB free energies in different nanocrystals reveal an intriguing result. The minimal surface GBs in SCs exhibit higher free energy per atom than those in the Voronoi nanocrystal. This discrepancy can be attributed to local curvature differences: while the GBs in Voronoi nanocrystals are nearly flat, the minimal surface GBs in SCs are highly curved locally, which may elevate their energy despite maintaining zero mean curvature overall. However, when considering the system holistically, Figure S5 reveals that the total excess energy from GBs in SCs remains lower than in conventional nanocrystals due to the reduced GB volume fraction. This trade-off between minimizing the total GB volume and increasing the local GB energy further explains the intrinsic size limitation of SCs."

The P-SC and the Voronoi crystal exhibit pronounced kinetic instability by \\(700\\mathrm{K}\\), characterized by significant GB migration and grain coarsening. As shown in Figure S6 of the SI, they will completely transform into a single crystal as temperature goes sufficiently high. Despite the P-SC being of TPMS GB structure, it does not demonstrate superior stability compared with the Voronoi nanocrystal. The failure of the P-SC underscores the limited capacity of the TPMS in SCs to retain structural integrity. This instability can be attributed to the high free energy concentrated at such unique GBs [Figure 4(c)]. Although the zero-mean-curvature property of TPMS minimizes the driving force for further GBs coarsening, thermal fluctuation can still disrupt the curvature, potentially leading to structural collapse. This observation aligns with experiments[20] and simulations,[22,27] in which the TPMS GBs are hardly found in nanocrystals."

Additionally, we investigated the size dependence of D-SC and decomposed the free energy contributions from specific crystalline defects. This comprehensive approach enables a thorough assessment of the SCs phase stability from a physical perspective. While lower free energy is conventionally associated with enhanced thermodynamic stability, it does not fully prevent grain coarsening in nanocrystals. In the absence of CTBs, GBs migration persists at high temperatures, because the GB free energy consistently exceeds that of a perfect lattice. The phase stability of SCs is governed by two critical factors. First, from a thermodynamic perspective, the free energy of SCs must be sufficiently low. This condition is met by minimizing the GBs volume fraction in SCs, although the GB free energy of minimal surfaces is not necessarily lower than that of conventional GBs in Voronoi nanocrystals. Second, from a kinetic perspective, the stability of SCs primarily depends on the role of CTBs in constraining GBs motion. This study provides fundamental insights into the physical mechanisms underpinning the thermal stability of SCs, highlighting the critical importance of the 3D interlocking topology formed by CTBs and GBs. The theoretical findings contribute to the design of thermally stable nanocrystals with unprecedentedly fine grains, potentially unlocking novel functionalities and properties of nanostructures at the atomic scale."
