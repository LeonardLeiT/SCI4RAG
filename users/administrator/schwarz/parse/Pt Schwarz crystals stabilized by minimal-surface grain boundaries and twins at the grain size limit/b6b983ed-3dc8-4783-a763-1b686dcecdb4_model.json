By refining the grains of pure Pt from \\(140~\\mu \\mathrm{m}\\) to several nanometers via plastic deformation technique, deformation twins were found to emerge numerously and the structural morphologies of Schwarz crystals can be identified at grain sizes below \\(4\\mathrm{nm}\\). Both experiments and atomistic simulations suggest that Pt Schwarz crystals are thermally stable at temperatures approaching the thermal equilibrium melting point. The measured room temperature microhardness as a function of grain size, on the other hand, may increase monotonically up to \\(12.9\\mathrm{GPa}\\), revealing a sustained Hall-Petch relationship. The observed outstanding mechanical stabilities can be attributed to that, regardless of the critical twin size and the stacking fault energy of the material, the plastic deformation at the grain size limit is solely limited by twinning and both the nucleation and bowing-out of twinning partial dislocations from GB sources are notoriously difficult according to simulations and theory."

For example, in metals such as Ni and Al [24-27], perfect lattice dislocations (extended) were found to dominate the deformation process at larger grain sizes (e.g. \\(20\\mathrm{nm}\\) for Ni and \\(18\\mathrm{nm}\\) for Al); whereas for smaller grain sizes, faulting and twinning led by Shockley-partialls may show up dominantly to contribute to plastic deformation."

As confirmed through high pressure torsion experiments [33,34], in ultrafine grains of Pt which may show a saturated microhardness of 255 Hv or \\(2.5\\mathrm{GPa}\\), no trace of SF or deformation twin was noticeable. So far, deformation twins in Pt seemed only observed in thin film samples about \\(10\\mathrm{nm}\\) thick via in-situ tensile deformation technique under TEM [29,"

Besides the high SFE and uneasiness to twin, Pt is also a metal of high melting point \\((T_{\\mathrm{E}} = 2041\\mathrm{K}\\) [40]) and large bulk modulus. It is therefore of fundamental interest to see whether twins and consequently stable Schwarz crystals can be produced at the grain size limit."

(2) locates well above our observed twin thickness and the agreement between the theoretical prediction and our experimental data is reasonably well for grain size below \\(6\\mathrm{nm}\\). No stress is actually applied to twins in our Pt samples. Instead, they are fully enclosed by minimal-surface GBs in SCs. Therefore, the comparison can be used as a measure to what extent a GB may stabilize a twin in terms of the critical size and the critical twinning stress (under which a twin will not shrink or grow) in Meyers model. For larger grain sizes, in particular for grain size above \\(6\\mathrm{nm}\\), the discrepancy between theory and experiments becomes larger. It is not surprising since no effect due to GBs has been ever included in Meyer's model."
