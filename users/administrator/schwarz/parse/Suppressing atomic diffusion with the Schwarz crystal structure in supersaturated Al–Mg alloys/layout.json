Eliminating diffusive interfaces by fabricating single crystals or heavily alloying helps to address this issue but does not inhibit atomic diffusion at high homologous temperatures. We discovered that the Schwarz crystal structure was effective at suppressing atomic diffusion in a supersaturated aluminum-magnesium alloy with extremely fine grains. By forming these stable structures, diffusion-controlled intermetallic precipitation from the nanosized grains and their coarsening were inhibited up to the equilibrium melting temperature, around which the apparent across-boundary diffusivity was reduced by about seven orders of magnitude. Developing advanced engineering alloys using the Schwarz crystal structure may lead to useful properties for high-temperature applications."

This feature enables substantial tuneability of structures at various length scales by tailoring the diffusion-controlled processes during the synthesis and subsequent treatments, resulting in a broad spectrum of properties and performance in metallic materials. For instance, Al alloys can be hardened with precipitation of intermetallic phases by aging around room temperature (3, 4). Strength and ductility of steels can be widely adjusted by manipulating diffusional phase transformations in thermomechanical treatments (5, 6). However, high atomic diffusivity makes structure and the customized properties of metals unstable when they are exposed to elevated temperatures or mechanical loading (7). Such instability becomes a major bottleneck in the development of metallic materials, greatly limiting their technological applications at high temperatures."

Nonetheless, even in single-crystal metals, the high diffusivity cannot be restrained at high homologous temperatures. Substitutional diffusion and self-diffusion are known to be governed by the vacancy diffusion mechanism (1). The equilibrium vacancy concentration in crystalline lattice rises markedly at higher homologous temperatures, unavoidably elevating atomic diffusivity."

Although it contains an extremely high density of interfaces, this structure exhibits a very high thermal stability against grain coarsening at high temperatures close to the melting point. Therefore, exploring whether this stable Schwarz crystal structure is capable of inhibiting diffusion of atoms in alloys at high temperatures is of great interest."

Both the precipitation reaction and the GB migration process that govern grain coarsening were kinetically controlled by diffusion of both elements. The density of GBs in the SC-8 sample was several times higher than that in NG-50, and GBs are often believed to be fast diffusion channels for atoms. Therefore, these diffusional processes may be expected to be kinetically promoted in the SC-8 sample rather than being inhibited. However, the experimental observations were the opposite of this expectation."

With increasing temperatures, the Mgrich regions melted preferably and expanded by consuming the surrounding Mg-poor solids. This scenario is exactly what we observed in the NG-50 sample.

Molecular dynamic simulations have indicated that in Schwarz crystal structures (17), atoms at interfaces are constrained to vibrate about their rest positions to maintain the stable minimal interfaces at elevated temperatures even in vicinity of the melting point. The constraint is so effective that violent oscillation of atoms with large deviations from their rest positions is not allowed, limiting the local collective motion of atoms. In other words, the constraint greatly reduces the possibility for the interfacial atoms to escape from their rest positions. Therefore, the diffusion of atoms was inhibited in the entire temperature range studied because diffusion coefficients are proportional to the jumping probability (2)."

The diffusionless feature of the Schwarz crystal structure in metals is of great importance for understanding the fundamental diffusional processes in interfaces and the transport dynamics in solid states, especially at high temperatures. The Schwarz crystal seems to provide a robust barrier for arresting the diffusion of atoms in metals and substitutional alloys, boosting stability up to melting temperatures. This stability is much higher than that for conventional alloys. Developing advanced Al and other alloys using the Schwarz crystal structure should lead to materials with useful properties for high-temperature applications."

Xu et al. found that a minimum-interface structure allows a supersaturated aluminum-magnesium alloy to be retained at temperatures higher than the melting point. This system is known for high atomic diffusivity, highlighting the importance of the underlying interface structure.
