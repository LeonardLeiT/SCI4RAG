Other physical effects will also be built into the next generation of GWB models. For example, recent numerical simulations of massive galaxy mergers predict binary SMBHs with eccentricities ranging between 0.1 (31) and 0.9 (32). If binaries radiating gravitational waves at frequencies relevant to pulsar timing arrays are considerably eccentric or predominantly evolving under environmental interactions (33), the spectral shape of $\\Omega _ { \\mathrm { G W } } ( f )$ may differ from current predictions (34)."

But the strain-induced refinement saturates at large strains, forming three-dimensional ultrafine-grained (3D UFG) structures with random orientations. Further refinement of this microstructure is limited because of the enhanced mobility of grain boundaries. Very-high-rate shear deformation with high strain gradients was applied in the top surface layer of bulk nickel, where a 2D nanometer-scale laminated structure was induced. The strongly textured nanolaminated structure (average lamellar thickness of 20 nanometers) with low-angle boundaries among the lamellae is ultrahard and ultrastable: It exhibits a hardness of 6.4 gigapascal—which is higher than any reported hardness of the UFG nickel—and a coarsening temperature of 40 kelvin above that in UFG nickel."

    "content": "Vickers hardness measurements in the crosssectional samples indicated that in the UFG layer in a depth span of 80 to ${ \\sim } 6 0 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , hardness varies from $2 . 7 6 \\pm 0 . 2 6$ to $1 . 4 0 \\pm 0 . 0 5$ GPa corresponding to different structural sizes. These results are consistent with the reported data for pure Ni (10, 18, 22) and the Hall-Petch relation (Fig. 2E). Measured hardness of the NL structures at 10 to ${ \\sim } 5 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ deep averaged $6 . 4 \\pm 0 . 3 2$ GPa. This value is much higher than that in Ni samples processed via plastic deformation reported in the literature (5, 10, 11, 18) and is comparable with that of the electrodeposited Ni with grain sizes of ${ < } 2 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ (23). Taking lamellar thickness of the NL structures as the equivalent grain size, we found that its hardness lies on the extrapolated Hall-Petch line (Fig. 2E). Such an agreement suggests that the NL boundaries are as effective in resisting dislocation motion as the conventional high-angle GBs. In fact, previous studies showed that contribution of low-angle boundaries to strength is comparable with that of highangle GBs in strain-induced NG metals (11, 24). In addition, presence of substructures inside lamellae [such as dislocations and twin boundaries as revealed in HRTEM observations (fig. S3)] may provide additional hardening."

With the measured parameters (table S1), a dislocation density of $\\mathrm { \\hat { \\Omega } } _ { \\sim 1 } \\times 1 0 ^ { 1 5 } \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 }$ was obtained for the UFG structures ( $1 2 0 \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ deep from the surface), which is in accordance with the measured result $( \\sim 2 \\times$ $1 0 ^ { 1 5 } ~ \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 2 } )$ in a torsion-deformed Ni at a comparable strain (25).

For the NL structures, it is surprising to see a much higher onset temperature for lamella thickening of ${ \\sim } 5 0 6 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ . This instability temperature is in agreement with that for the dislocation boundaries in deep layers of the sample (varying from $5 0 0 ^ { \\circ }$ to $5 4 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ , depending on the boundary spacing).

It is seen from Fig. 3, B and C, that the original NG structures transformed into micrometer-sized dislocation-free equiaxed grains—a typical recrystallization product—whereas the NL structures, apart from the slightly increased lamellar thickness due to a recovery process, retained their morphologies without obvious recrystallization. The 2D NL structures with a lamellar thickness of 20 nm are thermally more stable than are the 3D NG structures with grain sizes of $7 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ . The combination of greater hardness and thermal stability in the 2D NL structure is shown in Fig. 4."

    "content": "Formation of the NL structures is reasonably attributed to the large shear deformation with very high rates and large strain gradients in the top surface layer of the SMGT sample, which is distinct from the conventional heavy plastic deformation processes such as high-pressure torsion (HPT) and cold rolling. High strain rates promote dislocation multiplication relative to their annihilation (11, 30). The much larger strain gradients in the top surface layer of the SMGT sample than that in the HPT process (typically ${ \\sim } 0 . 0 \\bar { 4 } ~ \\mu \\mathrm { m } ^ { - 1 }$ ) means a much higher geometrically necessary dislocation density is generated because it is proportional to the strain gradient (14). Formation of more low-angle boundaries in form of nanoscale laminated structures is energetically favorable, with an increased density of stored dislocations for minimizing the overall excess energy. Nanoscale laminated structures have also been observed in shear bands that are locally sheared at high rates with large strain gradients in UFG iron samples after compressive deformation (31) and in the nanotwinned Cu during dynamic compression (12). Most boundaries in the sheared regions (or shear bands) in the Cu are of low angle, with an average misorientation of ${ \\sim } 7 ^ { \\circ } ( l 2 )$ . These observations, in accordance with our present study, suggest that formation of 2D NL structures with a very high dislocation density is a general scenario for strain-induced grain refinement in extremely small dimensions deformed at high strain rates with large strain gradients."

With the simple and cost-effective processing technique, this nanostructure will find potential technological applications in a wide range of industrial manufacturing processes."
