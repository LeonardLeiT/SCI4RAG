In this Letter, constraining effects of $3 D$ CTB network on the formation and thermostability of SC are addressed via atomistic simulations. GB migration and evolution of CTB network trigger formation of SC diamond. CTB constraints are critical to generate GBs of zero mean curvature underlying vanishing capillary pressure, and to counterbalance the elastic driving forces of lattice. GB motion can be suppressed at temperatures close to the melting point with GB aperture down to $3 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ ."

    "content": "In polycrystalline copper consisting of grains of a few nanometers in size, a metastable structure was discovered in which grain boundaries (GBs) constrained by quadrupolar network of coherent twin boundaries (CTB) resemble essentially the triply periodic minimal surface ( ) of Schwarz primitive diamond $( D )$ , as illustrated TPMS Din Fig. 1. Such polycrystalline structures of metals are found to exhibit superior thermal and mechanical stabilities than any other forms of metastable solid states known so far, for example, the metallic glasses. The extremely finegrained structures with GB or interfacial morphologies featured by any topological manifold of minimal surface, called Schwarz crystal (SC), may represent a novel type of intrinsic metastable state in polycrystalline metals at an ultimate grain size limit [1]."

It is remarkably hard at room TEtemperatures, with an ideal strength (more than 2 GPa) close to the theoretical limit. The structure does not break down in a sudden way prior to significant plastic deformations under tensile loading in the entire temperature range. Similar structures and behaviors are also observed in other face-centered-cubic (fcc) metals such as pure Al and Al-Mg alloys [20,21]. Exampled with Cu, the present study aims to address the transformation of Schwarz crystals from nanograined polycrystals with molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. Structural characteristics and thermal stabilities of Schwarz crystals are analyzed and compared with experimental observations."

Although we know now both general GB and special CTB in the Schwarz $D$ crystal mutually Dconstitute one symmetric solution of a unit cell representing a new form of the metastable state in fcc metals such as Cu [Fig. 1(b)], we did not tackle the problem in this way in the beginning. An alternative approach, the well-known Kelvin conjecture [31], has been initially implemented in our modeling and simulations, inspired by concept such as how possibly a CTB network may form in space, based on that truncated octahedron-shaped grains and numerous CTBs are frequently observed in extremely fine-grained metals like Cu revealing meanwhile an enhanced thermostability [1,32,33]."

Structure TS TEanalyses in terms of the 1st nearest-neighbor angular distribution function (ADF) indicate that significant amount of GB atoms is disordered [Fig. 3(c)], underlying that the GB migration is assisted by thermally activated GB diffusivities.

    "content": "Understanding the nature of GBs and interfaces is vital to predict material properties [40–43]. With this study, we demonstrated that limiting grain size of a few nanometers is approachable in conventional metals if an interface network is prone to a unique form underlying remarkable thermal stability. Our simulations show that in Schwarz $D$ -crystals, D GBs remain to be lattice defects highly energetic TPMSand intrinsically mobile. However, distinct from those as conjectured by Kelvin crystals, they are stable topological defects of vanishing mean curvature. GBs of much lower energies and intrinsically less mobile, such as CTBs in fcc metals, remain to be planar defects and may act as strong constraints against GB motion. Schwarz crystals, including those of lattice structures of other types, point the way for future advances of structurally stable materials."
