Alloying has been found to improve stability, but only in a few empirically discovered systems. We have developed a theoretical framework with which stable nanostructured alloys can be designed. A nanostructure stability map based on a thermodynamic model is applied to design stable nanostructured tungsten alloys. We identify a candidate alloy, W-Ti, and demonstrate substantially enhanced stability for the high-temperature, long-duration conditions amenable to powder-route production of bulk nanostructured tungsten. This nanostructured alloy adopts a heterogeneous chemical distribution that is anticipated by the present theoretical framework but unexpected on the basis of conventional bulk thermodynamics."

Whereas one approach to the problem is a classical kinetic strategy, that is, including alloying elements to slow grain growth, there is increasing interest in the notion of genuine thermodynamic stabilization of grain boundaries (12–18). In analogy to microemulsions, in which the addition of surfactant is used to stabilize interfacial area (19), the concept of thermodynamic nanostructure stabilization is to add to a polycrystal an alloying element (solute) selected for its preference to occupy grain boundary sites vis-à-vis those in the crystal interiors to relieve the energy penalty of the interfaces. The grain boundary energy, , is lowered from that of a pure material, $\\gamma _ { 0 } .$ g, through such segregation, gwhich in a simplified and linearized view can be written (12)"

    "content": "A few systems, both simulated and experimental, have provided evidence that this thermodynamic approach can suppress grain growth and stabilize nanostructured polycrystals (16, 20–28). Some authors have provided guidelines for estimating the grain boundary segregation strength given a base element by identifying preferred features of the solute, for example, atomic size mismatch with the solvent (16) or low bulk solid solubility (23, 24), both of which are presumed to correlate with a higher tendency for solute rejection into grain boundaries. By and large, these approaches amount to semi-empirical preferences for alloy systems that might exhibit grain boundary segregation and do not generally speak to true thermodynamic stability of nanostructures, which requires consideration of the relative stability of nanostructured phases to competing bulk phases. For example, existing approaches often suggest systems that experience other problematic structural instabilities beyond just normal grain growth, that is, abnormal grain growth or phase decomposition (21–24). We advance a thermodynamic model, with which nanostructure stability maps can be generated and used as a design tool. One newly predicted system, namely W with a minority addition of Ti, is evaluated and demonstrates stability at a length scale of around $2 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ over long durations at elevated temperatures."

For example, the likelihood of nanostructure stability has often been estimated by solute segregation strength based on atomic size mismatch and/or solubility. However, in the present system, the solute with the highest size difference listed in table S1 (Sr, ${ \\sim } 5 5 \\%$ mismatch with W) and those with the lowest solubility (Ag and Cu, essentially zero solubility) lie decidedly in the red bulk stable region in Fig. 1A. Also counterintuitively, the element with the lowest value of $\\Delta H ^ { \\mathrm { s e g } }$ in the set, Ti, is actual-Dly one of the most suitable candidates, being safely within the nanocrystalline stable region. In fact, Ti would be counterindicated by conventional approaches, which would seek low bulk solubility [Ti has extremely high solubility in W of 48 atomic $\\%$ at $1 1 0 0 ^ { \\circ } \\mathrm { C }$ (36)] and high atomic size mismatch (Ti has a low-to-moderate mismatch with W of only $\\sim 6 \\%$ )."

However, relative to their single-crystalline counterparts, the growth of nanoparticles that contain twin defects can be difficult to control because multiple competitive growth pathways can yield such structures. We used spherical, cubic, and octahedral single-crystalline gold nanoparticles as dual electron microscopy labels and plasmonic seeds to track the growth of multiply twinned silver nanostructures. As the bimetallic nanostructures grew, they successively developed twin planes to ultimately form multiply twinned nanoparticles from single-crystalline seeds. Collectively, these data demonstrate how a series of nanoparticles of different shapes and internal crystal structures are interrelated and develop from one another."

    "content": "In the case of defect-free or single-crystalline noble metal nanoparticles, shape control can be achieved by directing the deposition preference onto specific crystallographic facets through the use of additives or capping agents (3–8). However, nanoparticle growth can be more difficult to control when multiply twinned structures such as decahedra and icosahedra are involved because these structures can grow from multiple competitive growth pathways (3, 9–12). Unlike their single-crystalline counterparts, twinned particles can grow from either twinned or single-crystalline seeds. One pathway involves the nucleation of a twinned nanoparticle seed and its subsequent growth in a layer-by-layer fashion (13). Alternatively, a single-crystalline nanoparticle seed can develop twin defects during its growth (or through a coalescence/fusion mechanism) to yield a twinned structure (14, 15). Understanding from which of these pathways twinned nanoparticles develop is important for controlling reaction conditions so as to selectively enhance or suppress their growth."
