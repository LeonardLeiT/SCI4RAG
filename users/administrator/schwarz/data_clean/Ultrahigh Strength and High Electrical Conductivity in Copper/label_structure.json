The magnetization density is a linear function of the displacement $d _ { \\cdot }$ , where $M _ { \\mathrm { s } }$ is the saturation magnetization.

For the observed vortex displacement $d = 5 0 \\mathrm { n m }$ , the resulting average internal field is $H = 3 ~ \\mathrm { m T }$ . Assuming that this field powers the gyrotropic motion of the vortex center, the speed $V$ of the core can be estimated using $V \\approx$ $2 \\gamma b H / \\pi$ . This formula reflects that the precession of core spins by $\\pi / 2$ corresponds to the translation of the core by its diameter $^ b$ . $\\gamma$ is the gyromagnetic ratio. Therefore, using $b = 1 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ (15), we expected a vortex speed of ${ \\sim } 4 ~ \\mathrm { m / s }$ . However, the experimentally determined vortex speed after the field pulse was close to $1 0 0 \\mathrm { m / s }$ (Fig. 3). This leads us to the conclusion that the internal field near the core must be considerably higher than the average field estimated with the static susceptibility. By inverting $V \\approx 2 \\gamma b H / \\pi$ , we translated the measured vortex speed into an experimentally determined local field at the core (Fig. 3, right axis). The size of this"

We synthesized pure copper samples with a high density of nanoscale growth twins. They showed a tensile strength about 10 times higher than that of conventional coarse-grained copper, while retaining an electrical conductivity comparable to that of pure copper. The ultrahigh strength originates from the effective blockage of dislocation motion by numerous coherent twin boundaries that possess an extremely low electrical resistivity, which is not the case for other types of grain boundaries."

Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) observations (Fig. 1) indicated that the as-deposited Cu consisted of irregularshaped grains (most of them were roughly equiaxed in three dimensions) with random orientations (see the electron diffraction pattern in Fig. 1A). The grain sizes were between $1 0 0 \\ \\mathrm { n m }$ and $1 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ , with an average value of about $4 0 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ (Fig. 1B). Each grain contained a high density of growth twins of the {111}/[112] type. Measurements of the lamella thickness along the [110] orientation showed a wide distribution ranging from several nanometers to about $1 5 0 ~ \\mathrm { { n m } }$ (Fig. 1C), due to the fact that in this orientation, only (1\u000111) and (11\u00011) twins are edge-on, whereas (111) and (111\u0001) twins are inclined to the surface. The lamella thickness distribution showed a peak at about $1 5 \\mathrm { n m }$ , corresponding approximately to the average lamella thickness for the edge-on twins.

X-ray diffraction patterns showed an evident (110) texture in the sample, which is consistent with previous observations in electrodeposited Cu specimens with growth twins (10). The thermal stability of the as-deposited Cu sample was studied by examining the twin lamellar structure at elevated temperatures.

From a thermodynamic point of view, the formation of twins decreases the total interfacial energy, because the excess energy for coherent TBs is much smaller than that for conventional highangle GBs. Twins prefer to nucleate at GBs or triple junctions (TJs) to reduce the GB energies by means of the twinning-induced orientation change. Although an extra TB is formed, the sum of the interfacial energies (including GBs and TBs) will be reduced by twinning. Twin formation is kinetically driven, and the nucleation and growth rate of twins are controlled by the deposition conditions.

    "content": "In terms of the formation mechanism of twins, pulsed electrodeposition is a technique that is suitable for achieving the nano-twinned structure, whereas conventional direct current (dc) electrodeposition is not. The pulsed electrodeposition process differs from the conventional dc processes mainly in its high peak current density and its on-time and off-time alternatives. The use of the pulse electrodeposition technique permits electrolysis with a very high current density (several orders of magnitude higher than that of dc electrolysis) for a short period of time (0.02 s); that is, a very high deposition rate is achieved during the on time. The ${ \\mathrm { C u } } ^ { 2 + }$ ion concentration in the vicinity of the cathodes, which is greatly decreased after the high rate of deposition, can be effectively recovered by ion migration for the next pulse of deposition during the relatively long off-time period (2 s). Therefore, pulsed electrodeposition increases the density of nucleation sites because of a high current density during the on time, while interrupting growth and favoring renucleation during the off time, which facilitates the formation of multiple twins."

Roomtemperature (295 K) electrical resistivity of GBs in Cu (16 ) was measured to be about $3 . 6 ~ \\times ~ 1 0 ^ { - 1 6 }$ ohm\u0001m2 and is about $3 . 4 ~ \\times$ $1 0 ^ { - 1 7 }$ ohm\u0001m2 for stacking faults (17 ).

    "content": "considering a case where a (1\u000111) slip band interacts with a (111) twin as in the present sample, one may argue that $\\frac { 1 } { 2 }$ [011\u0001] dislocations would propagate across the twin, whereas the motion of ${ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } \\left[ 1 1 0 \\right]$ and ${ \\frac { 1 } { 2 } } \\left[ 1 0 1 \\right]$ dislocations would be blocked at the TBs. However, these dislocations could also propagate across the twins if they were to undergo dislocation dissociation reactions, such as $\\frac { 1 } { 2 } [ 1 0 1 ]  \\frac { 1 } { 6 } [ 1 \\bar { 2 } 1 ] + \\frac { 1 } { 3 } [ 1 1 1 ] .$ . With this reaction, a non-glissile Frank dislocation will be left at the TB. Other dislocation reactions are also possible in face-centered cubic metals. Dissociations of dislocation are energetically unfavorable and would require a concentration of stress at twin-slip band intersections, thus leading to strengthening. The strengthening effect of TBs acting as strong barriers to dislocation motion has also been demonstrated in an in situ TEM observation of the deformation process in a nanocrystalline Cu specimen (19). Consequently, twins can be regarded as internal obstacles to the motion of dislocations that may have a strengthening effect analogous to that of GBs (20). The considerable tensile ductility observed in the present Cu sample may be quantitatively attributed to the absorption of a high density of dislocations at TBs, as can be seen in the strained sample under TEM observations."

    "content": "Figure 4A shows a typical TEM image of the strained sample (after tensile tests), in which plenty of dislocations are identified in contrast with the low dislocation density in the as-deposited sample (Fig. 1D). Close observations indicated that most dislocations were located at TBs, with a spacing ranging from several to several tens nanometers, whereas few were seen inside lamellar layers, as in Fig. 4B. Distributions of dislocations were not uniform, because more dislocations were observed on the TBs separating thick layers and less on those separating thin layers. The inhomogeneous dislocation distribution may originate from the layer thickness effect as well as from different grain orientations. Statistical high-resolution TEM observations in a large area of the deformed sample revealed that most TB dislocations are either Frank dislocations $( \\frac { 1 } { 3 } \\left[ 1 1 1 \\right] ,$ which are non-glissile, as shown in Fig. 4C) or glissile Shockley dislocations $\\cdot \\frac { 1 } { 6 } [ 1 \\bar { 2 } 1 ] )$ . On some TBs, several Shockley dislocations were found to segregate together, making the TBs curved. These microstructure observations are consistent with the deformation mechanism discussed above, with a dislocation dissociation reaction $\\frac { 1 } { 2 } [ 1 0 1 ]  \\frac { 1 } { 6 } [ 1 \\bar { 2 } 1 ] + \\frac { 1 } { 3 } [ 1 1 1 ] .$ Nevertheless,"

Simultaneous observations of the Fe layer and the clouds, made by lidar during midsummer at the South Pole, demonstrate that essentially complete removal of Fe atoms can occur inside the clouds. Laboratory experiments and atmospheric modeling show that this phenomenon is explained by the efficient uptake of Fe on the ice particle surface."
