    "content": "Most metals exist in form of polycrystalline states consisting of crystalline grains and grain boundaries. These structurally defective boundaries make the materials thermodynamically unstable. Upon heating or straining, polycrystalline metals tend to be stabilized by eliminating grain boundaries through grain coarsening or transforming into metastable glassy phases when the grains are very small. Recently, we found a different metastable structure in polycrystalline face-centered-cubic pure metals and alloys as their grains are refined to a few nanometers with cryogenic high-pressure torsion. In this structure, named as ‘‘Schwarz crystal’’, the grain boundary networks evolved into the 3D periodical minimal surface structures constrained with high density twin-boundaries. It is thermally so stable that grain coarsening is inhibited at temperatures around the melting point, and exhibits a strength close to the theoretical value. Diffusional processes in alloys like precipitation of intermetallic phase, spinodal decomposition, as well as melting are inhibited with the Schwarz crystal structure. This paper briefly reviews the discovery of this novel metastable structure. The precursory process (grain boundary relaxation) in nanograined metals, formation and structure characteristics of the Schwarz crystals, as well as their thermal stability and strength in different metals and alloys will be introduced with experimental and molecular dynamic simulations. Perspectives and future studies on the structure will be discussed."

Indeed, amorphization was observed in alloys with specific compositions as their grain sizes are reduced typically below few nanometers (e.g., in Ni-P,[7] Ni-W,[8] Al-Mn.[9] Nevertheless, amorphous solids are compositional sensitive and rarely formed in pure metals and most alloys in conventional conditions.

With reducing grain size below about $7 0 ~ \\mathrm { n m }$ in Cu (and ~ 50 nm in Ni), contradictory to the common wisdom, the grain coarsening temperature increases rather than decreases. This unusual phenomenon originates from autonomous relaxation of GBs into low-energy states, triggered by their interaction with partial dislocations below a critical grain size.[10] The relaxed GBs with a reduced excess energy leads to an elevated stability for smaller nanograins against coarsening under thermal and mechanical stimuli.[10,11] The finding not only sheds"

Through careful structural characterization combined with molecular dynamic (MD) simulations, we discovered a novel metastable state in metals with grains of few nanometers in size, in which GBs evolved into triple (3D) periodical minimal interface (TPMS) structures constrained with dense twin-boundary networks.[12] The unique structure was named as Schwarz crystal structure, after the German mathematician, Hermann A. Schwarz (1843-1921). As proved mathematically in the eighteenth century, the mean curvature is zero at every point on a minimal surface: the positive (hill-like) and negative (bowl-like) curvatures balance one another. Hermann Schwarz found that the saddle-like shape of minimal surfaces can be constructed to extend forever in 3D space by a periodic repetition of identical curved units, forming the TPMS structures.[13] The building units can be assembled into 3D structures with different symmetries (P-surface, D-surface, and G-surface), dividing the space into interpenetrating networks. With such GB-network structures, GB migration is suppressed in metals even at temperatures very close to the equilibrium melting point $( T _ { \\mathrm { m } } )$ .[12]"

Previous studies showed GB structures can be adjusted to lower their excess energy through interaction with partial dislocations as demonstrated by MD simulations on a number of symmetric tilt GBs in metals.[32,33] A GB may dissociate into two or more GBs connected by stacking faults when partial dislocations emit from the boundary, resulting in relaxation in GB region with decreased excess energy. This GB relaxation mechanism was verified in Au and Cu[34] $\\mathrm { C u } ^ { [ 3 4 ] }$ under high-resolution TEM observations, which is consistent with an evidence in Cu that GBs are structurally relaxed by interaction with nano-scale coherent twins, so that atomic transport along GBs is retarded.[35]"

To clarify this, we intensified straining to refine nanograins further in Cu. We removed the top $2 0 \\ \\mu \\mathrm { m }$ -thick surface layer with nanograins from the Cu rod processed with surface mechanical grinding treatment, and deformed the foil again using torsion under a pressure of 10 GPa in liquid nitrogen. After rotation of multiple cycles, a mixed nanograined structure was formed in the foil sample, consisting of domains with grains of few nanometers in size embedded in regions with larger grains (averagely ~ 25 nm in size).[12] The extremely fine-grained domains are irregularly shaped and around ten micronmeters in size"

In such a process, atoms at GBs, together with those inside crystallites, find their own way to ‘‘emerge’’ into an atomic-level TPMS structure. In this sense, the formation process of Schwarz crystal seems a ‘‘self-assembly-like’’ structure evolution in metals triggered by intensive plastic straining at cryogenic temperatures.
