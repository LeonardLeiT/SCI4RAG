    "content": "or centuries, the development of structural metals has primarily relied on the art of alloying: combining a metal with other elements to obtain desired properties. Such processes aim to change the electronic and strain energy states of the lattice, so that its properties are modified, or form alternative phases with completely different properties. For example, alloying iron with chromium and nickel leads the formation of a layer that protects the material from oxidation and corrosion. Alloying iron with carbon produces harder ferrite and/or carbide compounds, or induces the transformation to a martensitic phase that is harder to deform. A broad tunability of the microstructural (and, consequently, mechanical) properties has been demonstrated by adjusting the alloy composition with the addition of an increasing number of elements — for instance, as many as ten different elements are now included in the nominal composition of state-of-the-art aerospace superalloys1 ."

    "content": "However, such a strategy may have a negative impact on the long-term sustainability of high-performing metals. Alloying makes materials development more resource-dependent, exposing it to the risks associated with progressive resource exhaustion and unavailability of critical elements. Moreover, alloyed materials with complicated compositions may become more difficult to recycle — in fact, it has been reported that the majority of alloying metals and metalloids in the periodical table are either non-recyclable or scarcely recycled2 . In addition, the overall production costs increase progressively with alloying, especially for those materials that include precious elements. For instance, adding $1 \\%$ rhenium in superalloys improves mechanical performance, but can double the total material cost. Hence, although the advantages of alloying in terms of properties are clear, special attention has to be taken to control the potential increases in costs and environmental burden related to this engineering strategy."

The imperfections could apparently act as alloying elements for tuning properties without changing chemical compositions. However, the widespread use of imperfections for materials development is limited by their instability. On mechanical or thermal loading during processing or in service, these imperfections become mobile and interact with each other, resulting in annihilation or transformation from one type to another — the effect of iron workhardening, for instance, is lost if the material is exposed to a thermal annealing process. Moreover, the generation of defects under ordinary processing conditions is limited and challenging to control — for example, plastic deformation inducing processes like rolling or drawing may introduce grain"

Several types of low-energy interfaces, including twin boundaries and low-angle boundaries, exhibit rather high stability against thermal and mechanical stimuli at the nanoscale. This has been used to simultaneously obtain ultrahigh hardness and thermal stability — which are usually mutually exclusive in conventional materials — in nickel with nanolaminated structures containing high-density low-angle grain boundaries4 .

Coarse-grained (CG) IF steels (a scanning electron microscopy image of their morphology is shown in the top right) are soft and ductile. Nanolaminated (NL) IF steels (a transmission electron microscopy image9 of this morphology is shown in the bottom right) are very hard but less ductile. Gradient nanostructures combining these two extreme morphologies provide a broad range of strength–ductility combinations as outlined by the dashed lines. X.C.

For instance, gradient distribution of interfaces with spacing ranging from the nano- to the macroscale is an effective strategy for strain delocalization4 , resulting in remarkable enhancements in fatigue resistance and reduction of friction coefficient and wear rates8 . Using this gradient approach, the mechanical properties of steel with a fixed chemical composition can be tuned across several length scales, spanning the performance of multiple steels engineered through alloying and other approaches (Fig. 1). This example demonstrates that proper manipulation of structure, quantity and distribution of imperfections may allow a reduced number of materials to fulfil a broad range of mechanical specifications required for the realization of advanced devices and applications."

The reduced number of materials used may also facilitate separation and sorting at the end of life, which constitute a considerable part of the total cost of recycling.

In conventional manufacturing, materials are processed to desired properties prior to shaping and component assembly. With this alternative approach, properties can be adjusted after the materials are shaped, with the added possibility of further manipulating the imperfections locally to impart specific mechanical behaviours at different points in the component. The modification of well-established metal manufacturing processes is, however, not a trivial task, and it can only take place once the technological advantages of this strategy, as well as its robustness against extreme processing and usage conditions, are demonstrated.
